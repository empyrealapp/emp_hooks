description: rules to facilitate developing in emp-hooks
globs: *.py
---
- emp_hooks relies on decorators to support integrations with services
- the decorators create subscriptions, which trigger the function when an update comes
- try to make hooks idempotent.  they should only get an event once, but this can not always be guaranteed
- keep hooks lightweight and focused
